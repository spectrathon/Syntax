## EV CHARGING AND MONITORING SYSTEM

EV HUB is an AI based EV charging and monitoring system. It is a 3 front approach to the problems such as fast discharging EVs and the problems caused by them to a large number of people.
Our 3 way approach includes:
1. COMPANY END:
   (i) EV distribution optimizer: Employing ML prediction algorithms such as Regression and support vector machines to predict an increase in demand of charging stations
   (ii) Dynamic Pricing: Employing ML algorithms to maintain a balance in the cost per unit of electricity so as to maximise profit
   (iii) Analytics: To help in understanding overall profit and losses of the company 
2. CHARGING STATION END:
   (i) Charging station scheduling
   (ii) Number plate detection for security purpose
   (iii) Payment Integration
3. USER END:
   (i) Route optimisation
   (ii) Real time updates
   (iii) Charging station - book slots
   (iv) Charging and Monitoring dashboard
